/*! 
 brief Subclass of RMAbstractMercatorWebSource for access to a fully-seeded TileCache source.
 
 TileCache directory zoom levels do not necessarily correspond to the internal zoom levels of
 route-me.  That is, route-me's default zoom level of 0 is comprised of 4 tiles (2x2), while
 a TileCache source could be constructed of some other power of 2, such as 64 tiles (8x8).  
 When itializing a TileCache source with initWithTSURL:zoomAdj:fileType, zoomAdj must be equal 
 to the power of 2 that corresponds to the number of tiles on one axis your TileCache directory.
 Therefore, given the previous example of 64 tiles from 8 tiles on each axis, zoomAdj = 3, 
 as 2^3 = 8.
